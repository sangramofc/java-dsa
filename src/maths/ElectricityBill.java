//Given an integer A denoting the amount of units of electricity consumed, you have to calculate the electricity bill (in Rs.) with the help of the below charge conditions:
//
//        For first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
//        For next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
//        For next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
//        For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit
//        An additional surcharge of 20% is added to the bill.
//        NOTE: As the electricity bill can have any real value (floating point), you have to tell the floor value of the bill.
//        Floor value of a floating point is the closest integer less than or equal to that value. For eg, Floor value of 2.91 is 2.
